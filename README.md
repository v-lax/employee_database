# Installation 
Before you fork and clone this repo to your local computer, you should first install mysql data base to your computer. Follow the instructions provided at this [link](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/). You will then have to create a connection to your mysql database. 

Once you have done that, you can then go ahead and fork, and clone this repo to your local computer. Run the files in the sql_queries folder, which will set up your database and create your tables, then run npm install to install all neccesary dependencies, and finally to start the application just "npm start" in your terminal. 

# Usage 
The app will ask you which action you would like to take. You can choose to add, update, view, or delete data from the database you just created. Check out the gif below to get a better understanding of how to use the app.
